# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.



#list:-

# Lists are mutable
# The implication of iterations is Time-consuming	
# The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.	
# Lists consume more memory	
# Lists have several built-in methods	


	

#Tuple:-

# Tuples are immutable
# The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
# A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
# Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
# Tuple does not have many built-in methods


# Creating a List with
# the use of Numbers
# code to test that tuples are mutable
List = [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5]
print("Original list ", List)

List[3] = 77
print("Example to show mutability ", List)


# code to test that tuples are immutable

tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
tuple1[0] = 4
print(tuple1)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# As tuples are stored in a single memory block therefore they donâ€™t require extra space for new objects whereas the lists are allocated in two blocks, first the fixed one with all the Python object information and second a variable-sized block for the data.


import sys
a_list = []
a_tuple = ()
a_list = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
a_tuple = ("Geeks", "For", "Geeks")
print(sys.getsizeof(a_list))
print(sys.getsizeof(a_tuple))


# Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
